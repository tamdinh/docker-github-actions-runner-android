# Preflight wrapper around the upstream myoung34 entrypoint.
#
# When CONFIGURED_ACTIONS_RUNNER_FILES_DIR is set, the upstream entrypoint
# copies the persisted config into /actions-runner and skips registration
# whenever a .runner file exists — with no validation of the stored
# credentials and no fallback to ACCESS_TOKEN. If the runner was meanwhile
# removed server-side (pruned by GitHub after being offline too long, deleted
# manually, etc), the stored credentials are dead and the container
# crash-loops forever without ever re-registering, even though a perfectly
# good ACCESS_TOKEN is sitting in the environment.
#
# This preflight asks GitHub whether the persisted runner still exists. Only
# a definitive 404 wipes the persisted registration, which makes the upstream
# entrypoint fall through to a fresh ACCESS_TOKEN registration (and store the
# new credentials back into the persist dir). Transient errors, missing
# variables, or unparseable state leave everything untouched, so behavior is
# never worse than upstream's.
#
# Intentionally not using set -e: preflight must never block runner startup.

log() { echo "[preflight] $*"; }

# The runner's IsConfigured()/HasCredentials() checks treat .runner_migrated /
# .credentials_migrated as equivalent to the primary files, so a wipe must
# remove all five or config.sh refuses to re-register while run.sh can't load
# settings ("Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'configuredSettings')") — a
# crash loop that never self-heals. The files are removed from /actions-runner
# too: the writable layer survives restarts, and the upstream entrypoint's
# persist-back step otherwise re-seeds the persist dir from it.
